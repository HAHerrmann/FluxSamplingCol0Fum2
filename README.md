# Flux Sampling With Protein Constraints

## Method 

#### Metabolic Model and Model Constraints 
* Here we impose constraints obtained from proteomics data on the [Arnold model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808102)
* We constraint the model using proteomics data of cold and control conditions of *Arabidopsis thaliana* Col-0 and *fum2* genotypes
* We conduct flux sampling on the different genotype and temperature models in order to understand the metabolic changes required for cold acclimation 

#### Feasible Metabolic Pathways 

## Results 

#### Export of chloroplastic PGA or DHAP via TPT are required for cytosolic fumarate production

#### DHAP export shifts to PGA export from the chloroplast under NADPH-limiting conditions
